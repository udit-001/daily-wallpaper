# Daily-Wallpaper

A python script to update desktop wallpaper on a Windows machine from a tumblr blog.

## Inspiration
I was tired of seeing the same boring Wallpaper on my Desktop everyday. After learning a little bit of Python, I decided to design a script that would update my wallpaper on it's own by fetching an image from a [Tumblr Blog](http://fuckinghomepage.com/).

## Usage
This script can be scheduled to run daily by using they Task Scheduler utility present on Windows. You will require a BAT script to run the script from the task.

If you want your script to work silently in the background, then you'll also need to create a .VBS script.

## Features 
It also displays a notification on your computer when the wallpaper gets updated.
